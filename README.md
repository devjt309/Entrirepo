Module 1 Project: Sales Analysis

The provided dataset is of Bike sales of a company along with the following data: ID, marital status, gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute distance, Region, Age, Age Bracket, Purchased Bike.
The project involves data cleaning and formatting and then preparing analysis of the bike sales along with other features. This would help the company understand the key factors affecting their sales and would help them to improve their understanding of their target audience(market).
1)The first interactive dashboard is based on the gender, there is a marginal decrease in the number of females when compared to males in terms of bike sales. The number of females who bought bikes were 243 and males were 252 which 3% higher than females. However it should be taken into consideration that the overall number of females in the dataset was also 4.5% less than males.
2) The second dashboard analyses the occupation of those customers who bought the bikes. Most of the bikes seems to be bought by Professionals and Skilled manual laborers at 30% and 24% ,this inference would help the company to identify the primary audience for the bikes and help to increase the marketing in this particular segment.
3)Third dashboard identifies the region of the customers who bought the product.44% of the customers seems to be from North America and the company should improve the marketing campaigns in the rest two regions pacific and Europe.
4)Fourth dashboard shows the commute distance of the customers who has bought the bikes,the commute distance for most of the customers is below 1 mile which might be due to the reason that they are using the bike for daily commute to their workplaces rather than long rides.
5)The fifth dashboard analyses the income status of the customers most of the customers fall under the income bracket of $40,000.00.
6)The final dashboard analyses the number of cars owned by the bike customers,the number of sales seems inversely proportional to the number of cars owned,which means the primary target market of the company should be the customers who own 2 or less cars.
